Here’s a quick list of these issues and how to solve\\nthem.</p>\\n<br />\\n<br />\\n<h3>First-time POSM install fails</h3>\\n<p>Did you prepare the USB stick, plug it into POSM, and try to boot… only to get\\nan error message? This can be an issue if your USB stick has an overall folder\\nthat contains everything that you extracted from the POSM <code>.iso</code> file. It can\\nalso be an issue if you extracted the files and then moved them manually onto\\nthe USB stick. There are hidden files in the package which will not follow if\\nyou try to manually move the contents. You can fix this by using an extraction\\ntool (like The Unarchiver for Mac or 7-Zip for Windows) to extract the contents\\ndirectly onto the USB stick.</p>\\n<h3>Re-installing the core POSM software</h3>\\n<p>Let’s say there’s a new version of the POSM stack and you want to upgrade. You\\ncan do this by following the normal first-time install process: download\\nsoftware, prep USB stick, install onto POSM. The software will overwrite and\\nprevious versions.</p>\\n<h3>I’m connected to POSM. When I try to reach any website, it should redirect me to posm.io but it sometimes doesn’t</h3>\\n<p>Secure websites (ie websites whose URL starts with https:// instead of http://)\\nwill not redirect to the posm.io homepage. So, if you click any link in your\\nbookmarks, it may not redirect to posm.io.</p>\\n<h3>Can I be connected to the internet and POSM at the same time?</h3>\\n<p>Yes. Plug POSM into Ethernet and, in the admin interface, turn on Bridge Mode.</p>\\n<h3>Can I use encrypted ODK forms to protect sensitive data?</h3>\\n<p>Yes. You will need to download and set up ODK Briefcase to do this.\\n<a href=\\\"https://opendatakit.org/help/encrypted-forms/\\\">Instructions are on the ODK\\nsite</a>. You will need to set up a\\npublic and private key and include the public key in your ODK form. To access\\nsubmissions, open ODK Briefcase and <code>Pull</code> the submissions, then <code>Export</code> them.\\nYou will get a <code>.csv</code> file with your decrypted data.</p>\\n<h3>Multiple deployments are buggy</h3>\\n<p>POSM sometimes has a hard time dealing with multiple deployments - it may\\nstruggle when making MBTiles archives, or when first loading a deployment onto\\nphones. We’ve solved this by just trying those processes again. It is also a\\ngood idea to keep the POSM “clean” by deleting old deployments that are no\\nlonger needed.</p>\\n<h3>How do I delete an old deployment?</h3>\\n<p>To do this, you will need to use an FTP client like\\n<a href=\\\"https://cyberduck.io/?l=en\\\">Cyberduck</a> (or command line) to connect (or “SSH”)\\ninto POSM.</p>\\n<p>Power up the POSM and connect to it from your computer.
