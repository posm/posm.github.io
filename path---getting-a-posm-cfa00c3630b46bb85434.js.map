If you want more technical info\\nor a less GUI-oriented means of setting this up, then head over to GitHub.</p>\\n<h3>Other things you will need</h3>\\n<p>The POSM hardware is a mini-computer. To set it up for the very first time,\\nyou’ll need to plug in the following:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>USB keyboard</li>\\n<li>external monitor or TV with an HDMI input</li>\\n<li>USB stick (minimum 4 GB)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>You’ll also need an internet connection with an ethernet cable to load an area\\nof interest onto the POSM and set it up for the field.</p>\\n<h2>First-time install</h2>\\n<p>First, download the <a href=\\\"https://posm.s3.amazonaws.com/releases/posm-0.7.0.iso\\\">core POSM\\nsoftware</a>. This will\\ndownload with the file name <code>posm-0.7.0.iso</code>. You need to move that onto a USB\\nstick and extract it into a set of folders, but first you’ll have to change the\\nUSB formatting (UEFI booting is the technical term for what’s being\\nfacilitated).</p>\\n<h3>Configuring the USB stick</h3>\\n<h4>Mac</h4>\\n<p>On a Mac, plug in your USB stick and open Disk Utility. Navigate to the USB\\nstick and click “Erase”.</p>\\n<p>Give the USB stick a name. Set the format to <code>MS-DOS (FAT)</code> and the scheme to\\n<code>GUID Partition Map</code>. Then click “Erase”, which will delete all existing files\\nand reformat the drive to make it compatible with the POSM. See below:</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/guide/getting-a-posm/format.png\\\"></p>\\n<h4>Windows</h4>\\n<p>On a PC, connect the USB drive, then go to “Computer” or “My Computer”,\\nright-click the drive and select “Format…” from the menu. Set the drive to FAT.</p>\\n<h3>Moving and extracting the POSM download (AKA “ISO file”) onto the USB stick</h3>\\n<p>If you don’t use command line, then moving the POSM download bundle involves\\ndownloading a file extractor to extract it (we use <a href=\\\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-unarchiver/id425424353?mt=12\\\">The\\nUnarchiver</a>\\nfor Mac or <a href=\\\"http://www.7-zip.org/\\\">7-Zip</a> for Windows).</p>\\n<p>On a Mac, open The Unarchiver and navigate to the <code>Extraction</code> tab. Where it\\nsays “Create a new folder for the extracted files”, select <code>Never</code>. The reason\\nwe do this is because the POSM download has to be extracted and moved onto the\\nUSB stick. Most file extractors will place extracted files into an overall\\nfolder. The POSM unit can’t handle this, and you can’t just manually move\\neverything one level up because there are hidden files that will get missed.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/guide/getting-a-posm/extraction.png\\\"></p>\\n<p>Use your extraction client (The Unarchiver or 7-Zip) to extract the download\\n(<code>posm-0.7.0.iso</code>) onto the USB stick… again, making sure that the files do\\nnot end up in an overall folder. On a Mac, you do this by right-clicking the\\n<code>posm-0.7.0.iso</code> file and selecting <code>Open with...</code> … <code>The Unarchiver</code>.
